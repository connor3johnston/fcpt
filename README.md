Auburn's Fundamentals of Competitive Programming Team is an accelerated Java curriculum meant to provide an easy transition to the more difficult problems and topics covered in the Competitive Programming Team. We would like whoever is interested to be able to compete in the competitions we attend.

This repository contains the problems used to teach Auburn's Fundamentals of Competitive Programming Team. It also includes templates to provide starting points on the problems we go over in meetings.
